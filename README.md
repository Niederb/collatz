# collatz
Helper functions related to the Collatz conjecture (also know as the 3n + 1 problem or the 3n + 1 conjecture).
## Problem
Given a positive integer N do the following steps repeatedly:
- If the number is even, divide it by two.
- If the number is odd, triple it and add one.
The Collatz conjecture states that for every positive integer you will reach one in a finite number of steps.

## Examples
- Performance comparison: single threaded vs using rayon
- Plotting collatz steps in the console for a specified number
